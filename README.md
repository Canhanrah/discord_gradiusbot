# discord_gradiusbot - Research and Development
A branch where strange things can happen and we play with very weird code.

# Reference Links
* [discord.py API - master](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/master/api.html)

# Random stuff I'm going to forget if I need it at some point
`pip install git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py.git@master`

# Current TODO
* Need to make sure we can update the item DB at any time with new item changes
* Consider changing the Item definition format from JSON to a python file potentially
* Put together help message
* Pagination helper: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#discord.Client.wait_for
* /inventory should have a filter argument to only show specific items
* fade out page navigation when you hit the end
* script for filling the DB with test data and multiple test items
* should figure out what this is useful for: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/master/api.html#discord.Client.add_view
